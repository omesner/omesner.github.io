Hello and thanks for visiting my website!

I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Department of Statistics](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats) at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu) working with [Liza Levina](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~elevina/) and [Ji Zhu](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~jizhu/), focusing on network analysis and algorithmic fairness.

I earned a joint PhD at [Carnegie Mellon University](cmu.edu) in [Statistics and Data Science](https://www.stat.cmu.edu) and [Engineering and Public Policy](https://www.stat.cmu.edu).
[Cosma Shalizi](http://bactra.org) was my primary advisor but [Liz Casman](https://www.cmu.edu/epp/people/emiriti-faculty/elizabeth-casman.html), [Larry Wasserman](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/), and [Alex Davis](https://www.cmu.edu/epp/people/faculty/alex-davis.html) also advised me.
My dissertation research focused on *non-parametric causal discovery*, estimating the underlying causal structure of a dataset as a directed acyclic graph without parametric assumptions, with a public health application on HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use and condomless sex among men who have sex with men.
 I am currently working on finishing and publishing the last chapters of my dissertation.

Before returning to graduate school, I worked as a biostatician at the [Infectious Disease Clinical Research Program](https://www.idcrp.org) on applications in HIV and sexually transmitted infections research.
At IDCRP, I worked primarily on the US Military HIV Natural History Study.
